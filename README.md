  final formattedDate = NormieDateFormatter.format(DateTime.now());

  // Validate your moves with an email address
  final isValidEmail = NormieValidator.isValidEmail('example@example.com');

  // Truncate the beat with a string
  final truncatedString = NormieStringUtils.truncate('This is a long string', 10);
  
  // Surprise your audience with a random color
  final randomColor = NormieColorUtils.randomColor();
